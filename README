A simple Django application for sending, scheduling, and saving simple text content across multiple sites using a pub/sub system.  Uses celery 2.x for scheduling tasks, the now-defunct Juggernaut and pub/sub system, and was built for Django 1.4.  Redis is used as a task queue for celery, a storage mechanism for the pub/sub system, and caching using Django's built in cache framework.

No longer in development, as new versions of celery and newer pub/sub systems handle nearly everything in this project aside from models.Announcement and tasks.send_announcement.
